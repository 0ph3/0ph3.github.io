# HTB CTF - Mango

## Box information

Mango is a medium difficulty Linux machine hosting a website that is found vulnerable to NoSQL injection. 
The NoSQL database is discovered to be MongoDB, from which we exfiltrate user credentials. We can use one set of credentials to gain a foothold using SSH, and the other to move laterally within the box.
A SUID binary is then exploited to escalate our privileges to root. 

## Enumeration
### Port Scan

As always, we will start by scanning for all open TCP ports.

```console
0ph3@parrot~$ nmap -p- --min-rate=5000 10.10.10.162
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.222
Host is up (0.11s latency).
PORT      STATE SERVICE
22/tcp    open  ssh
80/tcp    open  http
443/tcp   open  ssl/https
```
Once we have a list of open ports, we can run more enumeration scripts against open services.
Doing the version and default script scan separately will save time and reduce the overall network traffic.

```console
0ph3@parrot~$ nmap -p 22,80,443 -sC -sV 10.10.10.162
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.162
Host is up (0.056s latency).

```

Only three ports appear to be open. It's worth noting the nmap enumeration script found the staging-order subdomain name for mango.htb in the ssl cert's CommonName.
We will add both mango.htb and staging-order.mango.htb to our attacking machine's ```/etc/hosts``` file.
We could have also found this by inspecting the certificate from within the browser. It's always a good idea to inspect ssl certs as they may contain subdomains or even potential usernames.

It's also worth noting both web services are running on the same version of Apache 2.4.29. If they were different, it could mean we are dealing with containerized instances.

### SSH (22/TCP)
The ssh service itself isn't usually exploitable and OpenSSH 7.6p1 doesn't have any known exploits we can take advantage of at the time of writing this.
However, it may have misconfigurations that allow for other attacks like brute forcing. It can also be of used to gain access to the machine if we manage
to find valid username and credentials from the other running services.
For now we will move on to the http/https web services which usually provide a larger attack surface depending on the web application hosted. 

### https (443/TCP)
Navigating to either ```https://mango.htb``` or ```https://staging-order.mango.htb``` directs us to what appears to be a search engine made to look like the Google Search page.
The search functionality does not seem to return any data regardless of what is sent. No command injection,SQLi or NoSQLi payloads seem to affect the results returned or behavior of the server.

There is a link to the /analytics.php page in the top right corner.
However, it only seems to provide static data and which is displayed in a series of charts and graphs using the Flexmonster javascript component.

Directory busting the website only returns ```https://mango.htb/server-status``` page but navigating to it results in a 403 Forbidden error.

```console
0ph3@parrot~$ feroxbuster -u https://mango.htb/ -k

Vhost fuzzing does not return any results either

### http (80/TCP)
Navigating directly to ```https://10.10.10.162``` returns a 403 Forbidden status code.
However, using the subdomain found in the certificate, ```http://staging-order.mango.htb```,  directs us to the login page.

Trying some default credentials like ```admin:admin``` or ```admin:password``` leads nowhere unfortunately.
The next step we can take is to try some injection payloads to bypass authentication.
We can narrow down what injection payloads to prioritize by thinking about the application's stack and how authentication is being performed.
From our scans, we know this is a Linux server, running Apache and we know from the page extensions it is using php. 
If we assume a database is being used for authentication, the most likely application stack being used should be Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) or Linux, Apache, MongoDB, PHP (LAMP with Mongo).

We don't have any sucess with regular SQLi but trying a standard NoSQLi authentication bypass gets us logged in.
